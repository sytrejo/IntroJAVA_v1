//	1. What are hardware and software
	
//	A: A computer is an electronic device that stores and processes data. A computer includes both hardware and software.
//	In general, hardware is the physical aspect of the computer that can be seen, and software is the invisible instructions that control
//	the hardware and make it work. The hardware of a computer consists of a CPU, cache, memory, hard disk, floppy disk, monitor
//	printer, and communication devices.
	
// 2. List five major hardware components of a computer?
//	A: five major hardware components: CPU, MEmory< Storage Devices, Input/Output Devices, and Communication Devices
	
// 3. What does the acronym CPU stand for? What unit is used to measure CPU speed?
// A: CPU Stands for Central Processing Unit.
//	It is the brain of the computer. The unit of measurement of clock speed is the hertz(Hz), with 1 hertz
//	equaling 1 pulse per second. The clock speed of a computer is usually stated in megahertz(MHz). 
//	(1 MHz is 1 million Hz)
	

//	4. What is a bit? What is a byte?
//	a bit is a binary digit ) or 1. A byte is a sequence of 8 bits.
	
	
//	5. What is memory for? What does RAM stand for? Why is memory called RAM?
//	A: Memory size is measured in bytes.
//	Disk size is measured in bytes.
	
//	6. What is the primary difference between memory and a storage device?
//	A: Memory is volatile, because information is lost when the power is turned off. Programs and data are
//	 permanently stored on storage devices and are moved, when the computer actually uses them, to memory, 
//	which is much faster than storage devices. 
	
	
//	7. What language does the CPU understand?
//	The machine language is a set of primitive instructions built into every computer. This is the language understood by
//	computer and executed by a computer.
	
//	8. What is an assembly language? What is an assembler?
//	Assembly language is a low-level programming language in which a mnemonic is used to represent each of 
//	the machine language instructions. Assembler is a software that translates assembly language into machine language.
	
// 9. What is a high-level programming language? What is a source program?
//	The high-level languages are English-like and easy to learn and program.
//	The program written in a programming language is called a source program.
	
	
/** 10. What is an interpreter? What is a compiler?
 * 	A: An interpreter is a software that reads one statement from the source code, translates it to the machine code or 
 * virtual machine code, and then executes it right away. A compiler is a software that translates a program in high-level
 * language into machine language code
 */
	
/** 
 * 11. What is the difference between an interpreted language and a compiled language?
 * An interpreter reads one statement from the source code, and translates it to the machine code or virtual machine code,
 * then executes it right away. A compiler translates the entire source code into a machine code file, and the machine code
 * file is then executed.
 * 
 * 12. What is an operating system? List some popular operating systems?
 * The operating system(OS) is a program that manages and controls a computer's activities. The examples of OS are Windows
 * 98, NT, 2000, XP or ME Windows. Application programs such as Internet browser and a word processor run on top of an operating
 * system.
 * 
 * 13. What are the major responsibilities of an operating system?
 * Major responsibilities include:
 * 	-Controlling and monitoring system activities
 * 	-Allocating and assigning system resources
 * 	-Scheduling operations
 * 
 * 
 * 14. What are multiprogramming, multithreading, and multiprocessing?
 * Multiprogramming allows multiple programs to run simultaneously by sharing the CPU
 * Multithreading allows concurrency within a program, so that its subtasks can run at the same time. 
 * Multiprocessing, or parallel processing, uses two or more processors together to perform a task.
 * 
 * 15. Who invented Java? Which company owns Java now?
 * Java was invented by a team led by James Gosling at Sun microsystems in 1991. Originally called Oak, it became Jave in 1995
 * when it was redesigned for developing Internet applications. Oracle bought Sun and Oracle now owns Java.
 * 
 * 16. What is a Java applet?
 * Java applet is a special program that runs from a Web browser. Due to security reasons, applets are no longer allowed to run
 * from Web browsers
 * 
 * 17. What programming language does Android use?
 * Android uses the Java programming language.
 * 
 * 18. What is the Java language specification?
 * The Java language specification specifies the syntax for the Java language.
 * 
 * 19. What does JDK stand for? What does JRE stand for?
 * JDK stands for Java development ToolKit. JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.
 * 
 * 20. What does IDE stand for?
 * IDE stands for integrated development environment
 * 
 * 21. Are tools like NetBeans and Eclipse different languages from Java, or are they dialects or extensions of Java?
 * NetBeans and Eclipse are not programming languages, nor dialects, nor extensions of Javaa. They are Java development tools.
 * 
 * 22. What is a keyword? List some Java Keywords
 * Keywords have specific meaning to the compiler and cannot be used for other purposes in the program such as variables or method
 * names...examples of keywords are class, static, and void
 * 
 * 23. Is Java case sensitive? What is the case for Java keywords?
 * Java source code is case sensitive. Java keywords are always in lowercase.
 * 
 * 24. What is a comment? Is the comment ignored by the compiler? How do you denote a comment line and a comment paragraph?
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 25. What is the statement to display a string on the console?
 * System.out.println(string);
 * 
 * 26. see class Test
 * 
 * 27. What is Java source filename extension, and what is the Java bytecode filename extension?
 * The source file extension is .java and the bytecode file extension is .class
 * 
 * 28. What are the input and output of a Java compiler?
 * The input of a Java compiler is a java source code file and the output is a Java class file
 * 
 * 29. What is the command to compile a Java program?
 * javac is the JDK command to compile a program
 * 
 * 30. What is the command to run a Java program?
 * java is the JDK command to run a program
 * 
 * 31. What is the JVM?
 * JVM is the Java virtual machine that runs a java program.
 * 
 * 32. Can java run on any machine? What is needed to run Java on a computer?
 * Java can run on any machine with a JVM
 * 
 * 33. if a NoClassDefFoundError occurs when you run a program, what is the cause of the error?
 * Java interpreter cannot find the .class file. Make sure you placed the file in the right place, and invoked java command with appropriate
 * package name.
 * 
 * 34. if  a NoSuchMethodError occurs when you run a program what is the cause of the error?
 * The class does not have a main method, or the signature of the main method is incorrect. 
 * 
 * 35. What are syntax errors(compile errors), runtime errors, and logic errors?
 * Syntax errors are detected by compilers.
 * Runtime errors occur during execution of the program.
 * Logic errors results in incorrect results.
 *
