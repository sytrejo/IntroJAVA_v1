//	1. What are hardware and software
	
//	A: A computer is an electronic device that stores and processes data. A computer includes both hardware and software.
//	In general, hardware is the physical aspect of the computer that can be seen, and software is the invisible instructions that control
//	the hardware and make it work. The hardware of a computer consists of a CPU, cache, memory, hard disk, floppy disk, monitor
//	printer, and communication devices.
	
// 2. List five major hardware components of a computer?
//	A: five major hardware components: CPU, MEmory< Storage Devices, Input/Output Devices, and Communication Devices
	
// 3. What does the acronym CPU stand for? What unit is used to measure CPU speed?
// A: CPU Stands for Central Processing Unit.
//	It is the brain of the computer. The unit of measurement of clock speed is the hertz(Hz), with 1 hertz
//	equaling 1 pulse per second. The clock speed of a computer is usually stated in megahertz(MHz). 
//	(1 MHz is 1 million Hz)
	

//	4. What is a bit? What is a byte?
//	a bit is a binary digit ) or 1. A byte is a sequence of 8 bits.
	
	
//	5. What is memory for? What does RAM stand for? Why is memory called RAM?
//	A: Memory size is measured in bytes.
//	Disk size is measured in bytes.
	
//	6. What is the primary difference between memory and a storage device?
//	A: Memory is volatile, because information is lost when the power is turned off. Programs and data are
//	 permanently stored on storage devices and are moved, when the computer actually uses them, to memory, 
//	which is much faster than storage devices. 
	
	
//	7. What language does the CPU understand?
//	The machine language is a set of primitive instructions built into every computer. This is the language understood by
//	computer and executed by a computer.
	
//	8. What is an assembly language? What is an assembler?
//	Assembly language is a low-level programming language in which a mnemonic is used to represent each of 
//	the machine language instructions. Assembler is a software that translates assembly language into machine language.
	
// 9. What is a high-level programming language? What is a source program?
//	The high-level languages are English-like and easy to learn and program.
//	The program written in a programming language is called a source program.
	
	
/** 10. What is an interpreter? What is a compiler?
 * 	A: An interpreter is a software that reads one statement from the source code, translates it to the machine code or 
 * virtual machine code, and then executes it right away. A compiler is a software that translates a program in high-level
 * language into machine language code
 */
	
/** 
 * 11. What is the difference between an interpreted language and a compiled language?
 * An interpreter reads one statement from the source code, and translates it to the machine code or virtual machine code,
 * then executes it right away. A compiler translates the entire source code into a machine code file, and the machine code
 * file is then executed.
 * 
 * 12. What is an operating system? List some popular operating systems?
 * The operating system(OS) is a program that manages and controls a computer's activities. The examples of OS are Windows
 * 98, NT, 2000, XP or ME Windows. Application programs such as Internet browser and a word processor run on top of an operating
 * system.
 * 
 * 13. What are the major responsibilities of an operating system?
 * Major responsibilities include:
 * 	-Controlling and monitoring system activities
 * 	-Allocating and assigning system resources
 * 	-Scheduling operations
 * 
 * 
 * 14. What are multiprogramming, multithreading, and multiprocessing?
 * Multiprogramming allows multiple programs to run simultaneously by sharing the CPU
 * Multithreading allows concurrency within a program, so that its subtasks can run at the same time. 
 * Multiprocessing, or parallel processing, uses two or more processors together to perform a task.
 * 
 * 15. Who invented Java? Which company owns Java now?
 * Java was invented by a team led by James Gosling at Sun microsystems in 1991. Originally called Oak, it became Jave in 1995
 * when it was redesigned for developing Internet applications. Oracle bought Sun and Oracle now owns Java.
 * 
 * 16. What is a Java applet?
