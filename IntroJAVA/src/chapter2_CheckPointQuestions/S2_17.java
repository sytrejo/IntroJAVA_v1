 * 1. How would you write the quadratic equation in Java
 * 
 * 		a. (-b + Math.pow(b * b - 4 * a * c, 0.5)) / (2 * a)
 * 
 * Section 2.19.1
 * 
 * 1. Can you declare a variable as int and later redeclare it as double?
 * 
 * 		No.
 * 
 * 2. What is an integer overflow? Can floating-point operations cause overflow?
 * 
 * 		Answer: Numbers are storedd with a limited number of digits. When a variable is assigned a value that is too large (in size)
 * 		to be stored, it causes overflow. Overflow is for integer operations. Floating -point operations will not cause overflow.
 * 
 * 3. Will overflow cause a runtime error?
 * 
 * 		Answer: No
 * 
 * 4. What is a round-off error? Can integer operations cause round-off errors? Can floating-point operations cause round-off errors?
 * 
 * 		Answer: A round-off error, also called a rounding error, is the difference between the calculated approximation of a number 
 * 				and its exact mathematical value. Integer operations will not cause rounding error. Floating-point operations may cause
 * 				rounding error.
